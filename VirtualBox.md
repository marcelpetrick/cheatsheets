# Cheat sheet for Virtual Box (Oracle)

## handling

* HOST key is by default: right CTRL
* HOST + C: scaled version of the desktop
* HOST + F: fullscreen

## graphics / display

* for Linux guest VMSVGA is recommended (newer implementation); for Windows guest VBoxSVGA
* install VirtualBox-extensions and then while in fullscreen at the lower bottom the menu appears to set additional monitors (did not work or change something!) or press HOST + Pos1 (Home)
